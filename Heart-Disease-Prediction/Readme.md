# Heart Disease Prediction

## Objective
Predict the presence of heart disease using supervised machine learning based on patient medical attributes.

## Dataset
Heart Disease dataset containing clinical features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and ECG results.

Target variable: presence of heart disease.

## Approach

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature scaling
- Train/Test split
- Supervised classification models
- Model evaluation using standard classification metrics

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
